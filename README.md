This static library was made by weeal, a member of NewCorp.
The main focus of this library is to facilitate operations with strings in C.
To make use of it, you can use it in the same folder as your project or replace it wherever you want.


The code is open-source, that is, you can use it without moderation, just don't forget to reference me.
I'm not a professional in C, just a lover and fan of it. I am a student who is still learning, and this is one of my first steps.


Obviously there will be more versions of this library, this is the first one. Probably, over time, there will be new functions and new optimizations.
I'm trying to bring some object-oriented programming concepts to C;this String's part is the beginning,we are in testing phases. 

The information about the logic and how to use it is present in the code itself, so have fun and good luck.
